Input can be hardcoded for both of the programs

Question â†’ 1)  Write a program of Balancing Brackets, use a suitable data structure to print whether the string entered is a Balanced Brackets or Unbalanced String

Sample input

( [ [ { } ] ] )

Sample Output

The entered String has Balanced Brackets

Sample Input

( [ [ { } ] ] ) )

Sample Output

The entered Strings do not contain Balanced Brackets




Question 2) Find a pair with a given sum in Binary Search Tree
10,20,30,40,50,60,70

Lowest common Ancestor(20,30)=10
Lowest common Ancestor(40,30)=10
Lowest common Ancestor(60,70)=30
Lowest common Ancestor(20,40)=20


Sum = 130
Pair is (60,70)

If the sum is not found, print nodes are not found.
